This directory contains what it takes to build a doceker image for CSPL and run the tests

For information on docker see: https://hub.docker.com/

Then this uses Docker to test on different systems.

To use this run these commands:
- start docker on your system (on OSX this is boot2docker)
- cd Tests/Docker/CSPL_Tests
- docker run balarsen/cspl_tests   (this then displays the test output)
